# MTHGNN-Flotationcondition-identification
By constructing a temporal multi-modal hypergraph neural network, we encode complex high-order temporal features, establish robust associations between data structures, and flexibly model the features of froth image sequence, thus enabling accurate flotation condition identification through the fusion of multi-modal temporal features.
